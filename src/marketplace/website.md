### How to Publish a Website

There are a few things to know when you want to publish a website:

- Title: This is the title shown on your published content.
- Repository URL: A valid git repository URL where your content lives.
- Branch: The deployment branch on your git repository shows your content version to be published.

Example of a Website repository:

The folder file structure should look like this:

```
- src
    - index.html
    - css
        - somecssfile.css
    js
        - ..
    ..
```
