### How to Publish a Blog

There are a few things you need to know when you want to publish a blog:

- Title: This is the title shown on your published content.
- Repository URL: A valid git repository URL where your content lives.
- Branch: The deployment branch on your git repository shows your content version to be published.

Example of a Blog repository: [https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_tfblog](https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/www_tfblog)

You will use this name to identify this blog on your 'deployed blogs list' on the 3Bot Admin Panel Dashboard. Remember that this name would also be used as your blog's subdomain (a part of your blog's address).
