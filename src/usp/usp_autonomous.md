The management of the grid and the workloads running on it is not in the hands of humans. This creates the benefit of excluding both human error and malicious hackers. Bots take over the management and operational roles: we have defined the concept of a 3Bot as a human's Virtual System Administrator (VSA). How this exactly works can be read in the [security section](usp_secure), paragraph 'Deployment process'.
