# Get started with eVDC

There are several steps to follow to start your eVDC journey:

- Step 1: [Create your VDC](evdc_create)
- Step 2: [Access your VDC](evdc_access)
- Step 3: [Manage Your VDC](evdc_my_evdc)

Then you can have a look at how to manage your VDC:
- [Manage Compute Nodes](evdc_compute) 
- [Manage Storage Nodes](evdc_storage)
- [Wallet](evdc_wallet) 

Once set-up you can upgrade or downgrade your VDC:

- [Upgrade your VDC](evdc_upgrade)
- [Remove your VDC](evdc_remove)

You can find all the information on the different packages of storage and compute resources you need to run your eVDC [here](evdc_pricing).

To get started, reserve your packages and run your eVDC, you will need TFT. You can find a guide on how to get TFT [here](buy_tft).
