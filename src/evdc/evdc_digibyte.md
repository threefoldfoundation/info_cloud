# How to Deploy Digibyte Node on eVDC

Our partnership with the DigiByte Foundation empowers the DGB community with a decentralized cloud infrastructure to deploy DigiByte nodes and help secure and expand the DGB network across the geographical edges.

- Anyone can contribute and build upon the DigiByte Blockchain using the ThreeFold P2P cloud and its developer tools that provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers.
- Thousands of people are running DigiByte software all across the planet.
- Any server, computer, tablet or mobile phone connected to the DigiByte network becomes a node that helps relay transactions.

### Prerequisites

- A Digibyte node requires a minimum of 8vcpu and 32 GB of memory. So, minimum VDC requirements are a Gold VDC plus an additional big worker node.

### Get Started

You can now deploy your DigiByte full Node via the ThreeFold Now Marketplace's dashboard on your eVDC admin panel in a few clicks.

First, find the **Digibyte Widget** on the marketplace and click on **'Deploy'** button. You will now be directed to the chat flow of the deployment process.

Create a name for your new node deployment. You will use this name to identify your deployment on your 'Deployed Solutions' list.

Select the domain type for your Digibyte Node. For deployment with random subdomain, select 'Choose subdomain for me on a gateway',. For deployment with a particular available subdomain, select 'Choose a custom subdomain on a gateway. To deploy a Digibyte Node using your own domain, select 'choose a custom domain'.

Create a new username and password to access your new Digibyte Node.

Select the VDC capacity plan for your Digibyte Node workload usage. A Gold flavor configuration (CPU 4000m / 12000Mi) is sufficient at this moment.
