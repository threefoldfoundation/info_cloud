The `My VDC` panel gives an overview of the resources that make up your Kubernetes cluster - compute and storage nodes. It also manages the wallet that is setup specifically for this eVDC.

The `COMPUTE NODES` section of the `MY VDC` screen shows you the created Kubernetes clusters corresponding to your package.
