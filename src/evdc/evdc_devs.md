# Decentralized Developer

![](img/evdc_mktplace_developer.png)

Software development evolved to become distributed and scattered over the world, trying to work together. 

This has been a trend for a long time with off-shoring (geographically distributed teams cooperating in the development of an application), component-based software development (component and composite development) and Software-as-a-Service (service provider and client continue to interact at run time). 

A specific tool set is required to develop software this way, something ThreeFold has put together.

## Solutions List

- [Gitea](evdc_gitea): A painless, self-hosted Git service
- [Monitoring Stack](evdc_monitoring_stack): A health monitoring stack with Grafana and Prometheus for Kubernetes clusters.
