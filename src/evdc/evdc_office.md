# Decentralized Office

![](img/evdc_mktplace_office.png)

The world is increasingly relying on remote tools that allow us to collaborate and co-create from distance. The most used solutions for collaboration are office and project management tools. 

The current set of online collaboration tools created by the leading cloud companies are available in two forms; paid and free.

- Paid solutions provide a private environment and data is not collected. However, these remain rather expensive. 
- Free solutions come with terms and conditions that permit the application/ service provide as well as third parties to access the data. 

ThreeFold believes that there should be a private and secure version of those applications available to anyone at an affordable price and without data harvesting.
