# Top up TFT Balance onto Your eVDC Wallet

You can top-up the amount of TFT on your eVDC Wallet by sending some TFTs from your wallet via the TF Connect App.

On your eVDC Wallet page, copy your wallet address and send it to your mobile phone.

On the transfer page, paste your copied eVDC wallet address key to the `To (Wallet Address)` and define the amount of TFT you would like to send to your eVDC Wallet. Then click `Send Tokens`.

You will be then redirected to the confirmation page. 

> Note: Be sure you inserted the right transfer information, as the TFTs won't be retrievable once sent.

Click the `Confirm` button to issue the transfer. Your mobile screen will show a `successful transfer` notification once the transfer was processed.

Reload your eVDC Wallet Information page on your desktop after the successful transfer and you should see an updated TFT balance.
