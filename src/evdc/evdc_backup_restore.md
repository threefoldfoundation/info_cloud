# eVDC Backup and Restore

Each eVDC is backed up at regular intervals (for now daily). Next to these regular backups, also manual back-ups can be made. 
Back-ups are available for 1 month, after which it will be deleted automatically.

Two types of back-ups are available : 
- entries starting with `config` of the configurations
- entries starting with `vdc` are back-ups of the data

You could also find the information about your network, your wallet key, wallet secret and VDC expiration date on your eVDC Wallet Homepage.
