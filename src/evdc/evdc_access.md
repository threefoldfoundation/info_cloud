# Access your eVDC

Your eVDC always remains under your control and can be found by clicking on the `LIST VDCS` button on the homepage.

There, you can find a list of your available eVDCs and can manage the funding of their capacity. On the same page, you can also setup new eVDCs.

Before running your eVDC, a welcome screen with the `Terms and conditions` will appear. Please read through it and push `Agree` to continue.

The portal has two parts - VDC and Marketplace. Marketplace offers various ready-to-deploy tools and applications you can use on top of your eVDC. 

In case you are in the Marketplace, you can easily switch to `MY VDC` by clicking the button in the upper right corner.
