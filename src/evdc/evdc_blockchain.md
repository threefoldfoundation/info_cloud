Blockchains can deploy their nodes on top of the ThreeFold Grid and benefit from a truly decentralized cloud infrastructure. Deploying a node on the ThreeFold Grid can be done in a matter of a few clicks. 

Deploying on top of ThreeFold enables blockchains to achieve more efficiency, scalability and sustainability.
