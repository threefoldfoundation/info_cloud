# ThreeFold Edge Virtual Data Center

EVDC is the first peer-to-peer compute solution on the market. It provides the agility to create and deploy containers on the edge and allows for micro-services architectures. An EVDC can be deployed in a matter of a few clicks. 

EVDC makes it easy to set-up and manage the execution of containers and the interaction between them. It also offers DNS and IP addresses, automated load balancing at high traffic, automated rollbacks and rollouts and a self-healing architecture.  

It comes with the most widely used tools and frameworks such as Kubernetes and Helm Scripts. It is also fully compatible with industry standards such as Docker and major frameworks such as Grafana snd Prometheus. 

This enables any IT developer working with those standards to deploy their IT workloads on the ThreeFold P2P Cloud in the format they already use today.

EVDC offers the following computing benefits:

- Any containerized Unix IT applications can be deployed.
- Easy to set-up, orchestrate, and manage Kubernetes clusters as well as containers hosted on external clouds (hybrid cloud management).
- Docker compatible
- Create and scale your development environment easily with autonomous container management, load balancing and web gateways.
- Data is stored in QSFS (see above), offering the highest standard of security. 
- Self-healing and self-driving functionalities to ensure your workloads are always up and running.
- Hyper-competitive prices considering the advanced technology stack
