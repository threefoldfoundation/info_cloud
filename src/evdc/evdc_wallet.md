# eVDC Wallet

Each eVDC comes with a wallet to fund capacity reservation. It will keep the eVDC alive and running by using your eVDC wallet's TFT balance as your capacity reservation payment method. 

Top-up the required TFT balance to your eVDC wallet on a monthly basis for the capacity to remain available. 

You can also find the information about your network, wallet key, wallet secret and VDC expiration date on your eVDC Wallet Homepage.
