# eVDC Wallet

Each eVDC comes with a wallet to fund capacity reservation. It will keep the eVDC alive by using your eVDC wallet's TFT balance as your capacity reservation payment method. Top up the required TFT balance to your EVDC wallet on a monthly basis for the capacity to remain available. 

You could also find the information about your network, wallet key, wallet secret and VDC expiration date on your eVDC Wallet Homepage.
