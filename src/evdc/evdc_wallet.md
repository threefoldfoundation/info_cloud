# eVDC Wallet

Each eVDC is equiped with its own wallet. This wallet is used for funding the reserved capacity. This funding is needed to keep the eVDC alive. Top up on a monthly base the TFT balance of your eVDC wallet, and the capacity remains available. 

You could also find the information about your network, your wallet key, wallet secret and VDC expiration date on your eVDC Wallet Homepage.
