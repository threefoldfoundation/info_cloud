## Create a manual back-up

When you want to save particular configurations, a manual back-up always comes in handy. 

Executing a back-up is easy : 

- Click on the `+ CREATE BACKUP` button in the upper right corner.
- Give your backup a name and press `CONFIRM`. 

Now the back-up has been made and can be restored for a period of 1 month before being deleted.
