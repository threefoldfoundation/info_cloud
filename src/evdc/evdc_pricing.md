# Payment and Billing

## Price

An eVDC comes in different shapes. The price of the monthly subscription fees is expressed here in USD. The equivalent amount in TFT at a TFT price of 0.10 USD will be billed.

- Silver: 15 USD per month for a small Kubernetes Controller and 1 worker node, 4 GB memory, 100 GB ZDB Storage, a Network Gateway
- Gold: 30 USD per month for a small Kubernetes Controller and 1 worker node, 4 GB memory, 2TB ZDB Storage, a Network Gateway
- Platinum: 80 USD per month for a small Kubernetes Controller and 2 worker nodes, 8 GB memory, 10TB ZDB storage, a Network Gateway 
- Diamond: 200 USD per month for a small Kubernetes Controller and 4 worker nodes, 32 GB memory, 10TB ZDB storage, a Network Gateway

**Note:** Above pricing is for Mainnet. Testnet pricing will be 1/10 of the Mainnet pricing. Please consider that Testnet is not meant for production: continuity of the operations for your eVDC is not guaranteed, and the available capacity is inferior to the mainnet one.

### Adding nodes

For additional Kubernetes node, following prices apply:

- 24 USD for a medium node extension: 4vcpu, 8 GB mem, 50 GB SSD storage
- 48 USD for a big node extension: 8vcpu, 32 GB mem, 100 GB SSD storage

## Billing

A user prepays the setup of his eVDC according to the above prices with an eVDC provider. Once the payment is issued, the provisioning of hardware for Kubernetes clusters can start.

## Top-up

After the creation of your eVDC, you have transferred an amount that is sufficient for your VDC to remain up and running for 1 month. 

Two weeks before expiration, you will receive a request to top up your wallet so that it has sufficient funding available to remain available.
