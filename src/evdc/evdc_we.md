# Decentralized We

![](img/evdc_mktplace_we.png)

`Decentralized We` provides peer-to-peer alternatives to the applications and tools we use every day to share and connect with the people around us. You'll find private and secure communication and publishing tools that ensure that all data remains private to the user, and that what is shared publicly remains owned by the data owner/author. 

## Solutions List

- [Blog](evdc_blog): A P2P alternative to Tumblr or Blogspot
- [Website](evdc_website): A P2P alternative to centralized cloud-hosted websites. Host your own website with a unique IP and a public domain.
- [Wiki](evdc_wiki): Create your knowledge base with a unique IP and a public domain.
- [Discourse](evdc_discourse): An open-source forum built to educate members about civil community engagement
- [Peertube](evdc_peertube): An open-source video platform that uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce load on individual servers while viewing videos.

## Coming Soon

- __Mozilla Hubs__ Virtual Space 
- __Bookstack__ Knowledge Base
