# Deploy a Presearch node

Decentralize [Presearch](https://presearch.io)'s search engine by deploying a Presearch node on ThreeFold P2P Cloud.

Anyone can contribute and build upon the Presearch Blockchain using the ThreeFold P2P Cloud. The available developer tools provide significant advantages over centralized cloud providers.

Presearch Nodes are used to process user search requests, and node operators earn Presearch PRE tokens for joining and supporting the network.

# Get Started

When logged in to eVDC, find the `Presearch` widget in Marketplace, on your admin panel and click on the `Deploy` button. 

You will be directed to a chat flow for the deployment process.

Create a name for your DigiByte node. This name will be used to identify your deployment on your `Deployed Solutions` list.

Select the domain type for your Cryptpad:
- For deployment with **random subdomain**, select `Choose subdomain for me on a gateway`. 
- For deployment with a particular **available subdomain**, select `Choose a custom subdomain on a gateway`. 
- To host a blog using **your own domain**, select `choose a custom domain`.

Paste this code into the `Enter Registration Code` field when requested.

Choose the size of the capacity that you want to reserve for this solution, both in terms of compute power and memory capacity. 

The silver package should be sufficient for now.

Congratulations! you just successfully deployed a Presearch node. on the ThreeFold_Grid!

The url that gives access to your DigiByte node can be found on the next screen, or in the deployed solutions overview.

When you click it, you will be re-directed to the stats page of your node. There, you can find all the information you need to monitor your node, including the log data showing your node activity. 

The node normally restarts with updates of the images. Restart it manually with the `Restart` button. 

The `Refresh` button reloads the webpage.

Also you can see the node on the [Presearch website](https://nodes.presearch.org/dashboard). Stake at least 1000 PRE and your node becomes accessible for searches.
