# Monitor Kubernetes Clusters using Monitoring Stack

## What is Prometheus

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is a free software application used for event monitoring and alerting. It records real-time metrics in a time series database, allowing for high dimensionality.

## What is Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com) has become the worldâ€™s most popular technology used to compose observability dashboards with everything from Prometheus & Graphite metrics to logs and application to data power plants and beehives.

## Getting Started

The monitoring stack is available as a solution in the Marketplace.

Click `Deploy` and go through a simple chat flow to configure the monitoring of your cluster.

A few elements need to be provided. First, give your monitoring the name you want (it will be part of the url).

You can configure the URL to be auto-generated or part of your domain.

After setting up the name of your monitoring and configuring the URL, the Monitoring Stack will be deployed.

You will be provided with URLs to access your monitoring solution, with both UIs on Prometheus and Grafana.
