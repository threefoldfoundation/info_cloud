Through this panel, you can easily deploy and manage pre-configured applications in your VDC. The deployment of these solutions were made simple for anyone to get started in a few clicks. The list contains both peer-to-peer applications and off-the-shelf tooling to manage your Kubernetes cluster on your eVDC.


## Pre-Requisite

- [Deploy your eVDC](evdc_deploy). 

 If you already have your eVDC deployed, you can skip that step.
