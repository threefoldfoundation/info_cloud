# Import eVDC Wallet to External Wallet

After funding your eVDC Wallet with additional TFT, you could also transfer this balance to another eVDC Wallet, or any other stellar wallet. This can be done by importing your eVDC Wallet to an external wallet. 

There are a few different wallet options you can import your eVDC Wallet to. Read more about the supported wallets information on [How get and store TFT tutorial](https://manual2.threefold.io/#/mainnet_gettft).

On testnet, a TFT transfer/wallet import is recommended periodically. Since testnet is used for testing purposes, there will be times when a testnet reset is necessary to be done. 

> Note: Testnet reset will delete your evdc wallet, workloads, solutions and evdc accounts. 

Therefore, it is highly recommended to import your testnet eVDC Wallet to an external wallet and transfer their TFT Balance out to another wallet before the reset takes place. 

> Disclaimer: Please keep in mind that we will not be able to refund any TFT after a testnet reset is done. ThreeFold is not responsible for any loss resulting from the failure to import your eVDC wallet before a reset.
