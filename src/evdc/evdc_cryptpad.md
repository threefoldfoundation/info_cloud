# Deploy a Cryptpad instance

[Cryptpad](https://cryptpad.fr/) is a private-by-design office tools alternative. It has most of the crucial functionalities you would be using in Google Docs and Microsoft Office.

Content stored on CryptPad is fully encrypted, which means no one can access the documents without shared permissions. Encryption happens in the browser that is used to access the "pads" â€“ and therefore the central storage facility used does not see un-encrypted data and only sees encrypted data passing by.

## Get Started

When logged in to eVDC, find the `Cryptpad` widget in Marketplace, on your admin panel and click on the `Deploy` button.

Create a name for your Cryptpad instance. This name will be used to identify your deployment on your `Deployed Solutions` list.

You can choose to create a URL which is part of your domain, or have one auto-generated.

Select the domain type for your Cryptpad:
- For deployment with **random subdomain**, select `Choose subdomain for me on a gateway`. 
- For deployment with a particular **available subdomain**, select `Choose a custom subdomain on a gateway`. 
- To host a blog using **your own domain**, select `choose a custom domain`.
