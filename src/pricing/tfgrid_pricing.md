The Threefold grid has very attractive pricing models.

- pricing is done based on cloud units (see [cloud_units](threefold:cloud_units))

### Typically the price is in the range of

| cloud unit type   | description                                | pricing level   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| Compute Unit (CU) | typically 2 vcpu, 4 GB mem, 50 GB storage  | 10-12 USD/month |
| Storage Unit (SU) | typically 1 TB of netto usable storage (*) | 6-15 USD/month  |
| Network Unit (NU) | 1 GB transfer                              | free for now    |


Starting from TFGrid 3.0 the prices are not expressed in USD but TFT.

> [TFT's can be bought on multiple locations](threefold:how_to_buy_and_sell).

### Compare the price with other cloud vendors.

A good site to compare is cloudorado: https://www.cloudorado.com/

ThreeFold tries to have a price which is less than half of centralized cloud vendors.
