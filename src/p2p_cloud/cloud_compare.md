# Cloud vs Blockchain vs ThreeFold P2P Cloud 

# Benefits of P2P Cloud development 

Developers and users have many reasons for choosing the ThreeFold P2P Cloud:

- Anyone who is on the network has permission to use the service – or in other words, permission isn’t required.
- No one can block you or deny you access to the service.
- Payments are built-in via the native token, the ThreeFold Token (TFT).
- ThreeFold integrated with the most widely used protocols and systems meaning you can pretty much program anything.
- Transactions and workloads can scale limitlessly as it is truly decentralized. They do not have to be processed by any intermediaries as they get propagated end-to-end throughout the network directly to the intended recipients.
- Building applications and infrastructures on the ThreeFold Grid is more affordable than on web 2.0 and web 3.0.
- The “zero people” approach to the ThreeFold P2P Cloud enables to bring incredible security features. With it’s end-to-end model between users and servers, there are no back-doors, and by not using TCP/IP, there are no incoming connections from the web2.0 Internet.
By it’s peer-to-peer nature, storing and exchanging information and value on the ThreeFold Grid requires 50% to 99% less energy than on web 2.0.

# Implications of P2P Cloud development 

While beating public clouds on almost all perspectives, moving to the ThreeFold Grid requires some adaptation. Interacting with ThreeFold’s peer-to-peer infrastructure may require some learning to get started. The team is continuously working on integrating and automating more features to improve developer and user experiences.
