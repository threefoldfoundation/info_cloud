### Monitor K3s clusters

You can monitor your k3s clusters' health on your eVDC easily with a Monitoring Stack available on the Marketplace or on your local machine. 

The Monitoring Stack comes with a Helm chart `kube-prometheus-stack`, which provides Prometheus and Grafana as tooling to monitor your VDC. 

You can find a guide-through the [Monitoring Stack](evdc_monitoring_stack).

If you prefer to monitor your VDC locally with a Kubernetes IDE such as Lenc, see [Local Monitoring](evdc_monitoring_local).
